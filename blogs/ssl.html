          The secure sockets layer (SSL) is a standard security technology used
          for encrypting or securing the exchange of data between two computers
          on a network. The two systems/computers can be a browser and a server,
          or two users connected on a social site like Facebook.
        </p>
        <p>
          SSL is a certificate that a website owns so that data can be
          transferred securely on that website. It acts like a blanket over the
          information that is sent over the network, and the information is
          secure the same as important documents in the locker of the house. It
          prevents bad hackers from reading any kind of information that is
          being transferred over the site.
        </p>
        <h2>TLS</h2>
        <p>
          Transfer layer security (TLS) is just an updated version of SSL. It
          works the same way as SSL and is widely used nowadays. It makes the
          connection more reliable and private. TLS is considered safer than SSL
          because some browsers no longer support SSL.
        </p>
        <h2>Check if a webite is secure?</h2>
        <p>
          Users can check if the site they are using is secure or not. There are
          some visual implications of SSL that can be checked before sending any
          sensitive information on any social website.
        </p>
        <p>
          Firstly, check for the encrypted lock sign in front of the URL on the
          address bar. When you click on that lock, it pops up a message which
          tells that this site is secure.
        </p>
        <p>
          Secondly, having <strong>https://</strong> instead of
          <strong>http://</strong> in the beginning of the URL, identifies the
          site is secure.
        </p>

        <p>
          Fig2 represents the two visual signs by which, anyone can look for
          before sending any confidential stuff on any website.
        </p>
        <h2>What does secure mean in case of websites?</h2>
        <p>
          Secure means that only authorized people can access information
          provided by the user. When the network is secure, the information sent
          by the user is encrypted. Encryption means converting the data into an
          unreadable form and when it is only received on the expected end, it
          gets converted into the original form again. Encryption is done by
          using algorithms.
