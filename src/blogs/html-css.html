        <p>
          Did you ever imagined yourself coding very well? After reading this,
          you will know how to start coding.
        </p>

          Html and CSS are two languages used to insert and design content in
          the browser.<strong> HTML </strong>stands for
          <strong>Hypertext Markup Language</strong> and
          <strong>CSS</strong> stands for
          <strong>Cascading Style Sheets</strong>. They are tools to build
          websites. This can be similar to designing the interior of a house.
          The browser Window is a container, you can design it however you want
          and put any content inside.
        </p>
        <h3>HTML</h3>
        <p>
          HTML is a language that the browser understands. It has plenty of tags
          that build different areas of the browser window. A
          <strong>tag</strong> is an abbreviation that is used to wrap the
          content of the web page. Tags have three types- opening tag, closing
          tag, and empty tag. An element consists of both opening and closing
          tags.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most important five tags which are required for every website are
          Doctype, html, head, title, and body. These five tags should always be
          there to build a webpage.
        </p>
       <p>
         <figure>
            <pre>
          <<code>!DOCTYPE html</code>>
          <<code>html</code>>
          <<code>head</code>>
            <<code>title>Document</code><<code>/title</code>>
          <<code>/head</code>>
          <<code>body</code>>
            <code>//put all the code for the webpage</code>
          <<code>/body</code>>
          <<code>/html</code>>
        </pre>
        <figcaption>Fig2: Necessary tags for all the webpages</figcaption>
         </figure>
         
          
       </p>
        <p>In the code above, the first necessary tag "!DOCTYPE html" just tells that this file is written in html. It only has an opening tag and no closing tag, and these types of tags are empty tags. After that, is a "html" tag which consists of a whole browser window and everything we want to add to our webpage should go inside it. It has both opening and closing tags. Opening tags have angle brackets<> around them. Closing tags have a backslash after the first angle bracket and then the tag name followed by a closing angle bracket </>.  </p>
        <p>
          HTML elements can be inline or block. Inline elements are those which just occupy the required space horizontally.  Block elements occupy all the empty space horizontally on the screen. In the given figure, text with an orange background is wrapped inside an inline element and the other one is wrapped inside a block element.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <img src="../images/inline-block.png" alt="picture to represent inline and block element">
          <figcaption>Fig3: An example to represent how inline and block elements work</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>
          An html attribute can be used to provide style and functionality to the element. They are added to the opening tag before closing an angle bracket, for example:
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            <<code>tag attribute = "value"> </code><<code>/tag</code>>
          </pre>
        <figcaption>Fig4: representing how to use attibutes</figcaption>
        </figure>
       

        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>
          CSS is used to provide style to the content of the web page. For example, colour to the text, background image to the page, etc. To design a page, firstly we must select the tag we want to design, this is called the CSS selector. Then after the selector, we need curly brackets and inside those curly brackets we can insert CSS rules. CSS rules are a set of properties we want on any particular tag. Every property has a value in front of it that is called CSS value.
        </p>
        <figure>
          <pre>
            selector {
              property : value
            }
          </pre>
          <figcaption>fig5: syntax for selecting and putting css on the selected elements</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <p>
          In the picture above, p is the CSS selector and inside {} is a ruleset of properties we want to give to the selector.
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion">
          To conclude, HTML is a language to fill content in the browser window and CSS is used to give style to that content. Both work together and can be used to build very beautiful websites. With this knowledge, you can have a little idea of what HTML and CSS are. Now, you know how to connect content and design in the browser to develop something beautiful.
