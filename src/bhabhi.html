          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.bhabhi.org/">Bhabhi(opens in new tab)</a> is an
          Indian card game. The goal of the game is to get rid of all the cards
          a player has. The last player who left with cards loses the game. The
          loser is called <strong>Bhabhi.</strong> Bhabhi can be played while
          spending quality time with your family and friends. It is a mind game
          that enhances critical thinking skills. If you want to know more about

          The article below will give you some strategies to win the game.

        <dl>
            <dt>Do the following calculations for your cards:</dt>
            <dd>You
            should always count your number of safe turns before you start
            playing. Below are some calculations to count how many times, you
            can safely put down a higher card of a certain suit when somebody
            else is dealing:
            <table>
              <thead>
                <tr>
                  <th>Calculations</th>
                  <th>Spade</th>
                  <th>Club</th>
                  <th>Heart</th>
                  <th>Diamond</th>
                </tr>
              </thead>
              <tbody>
                <tr>
                  <td>
                    Assume you have following number of cards of each suit
                  </td>
                  <td>4</td>
                  <td>1</td>
                  <td>5</td>
                  <td>3</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Subtract your number of cards from 13</td>
                  <td>13 - 4 = 9</td>
                  <td>13 - 1 = 12</td>
                  <td>13 - 5 = 8</td>
                  <td>13 - 3 = 10</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>
                    Divide the number left after subtraction by the total number
                    of players (lets say you are 4 players playing)
                  </td>
                  <td>9/4 = 2.2</td>
                  <td>12/4 = 3</td>
                  <td>8/4 = 2</td>
                  <td>10/4 = 2.5</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                  <td>Calculated Safe turns</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>3</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                  <td>2</td>
                </tr>
              </tbody>
            </table>
            Now, you have calculated the number of safe turns. Safe turn means
            that you can put a higher numbered card than the cards already in
            the current turn’s card deck. In this case, the number of safe turns
            are only 2 for spades, hearts, and diamonds and 3 rounds of clubs.
            There can be fewer safe turns on the corresponding suits than you
            calculated, but cannot be more than that.
          </dd>
            <dt> Remember all the cards that are wasted: </dt>
            <dd>It is
            important to remember the cards that were put down by all the
            players and are now in the waste cards pile. So, you can make
            guesses for other player’s cards and can make a game-changing move.
            Having a sharp memory can be the strongest point for a player.
          </dd>
          <dt>Always try to get rid of your bigger cards first</dt>
          <dd>
            If
            you are a dealer, you should try to remove all your bigger cards at
            the beginning of your game. Your smaller cards will help you avoid
            dealing and you can win easily.
          </dd>
          <dt>Avoid dealing in the end:</dt>
           <dd>
            When you are near to the
            end of the game, try to avoid dealing. If you get into the dealing
            position, put a small numbered card down. When somebody will not
            have a smaller numbered card, they will have to put a bigger
            numbered card. They will have to deal in the next card. That is what
            you can take advantage of.
          </dd>
          <dt>Avoid increasing your cards:</dt>
          <dd>
             There are some
            situations when you have to pick up the pile and play with it, so be
            careful and avoid those situations. Some of the situations when you
            have to pick up the pile are listed below:
            <ul class="card-increasing-situations">
              <li>
                When somebody is unable to follow the suit and your card is the
                biggest numbered card in the current turn pile, then you have to
                pick up the pile. So if you have a smaller card in that
                situation, put that down.
              </li>
              <li>
                When it is not your turn, but you put a card down by mistake.
              </li>
              <li>
                When you have a card to follow the suit, but you put a card down
                from another suit, by chance.
              </li>
            </ul>
          </dd>
        </dl>
        <p class="conclusion">
          Now, you know some strategies to win the game. Try implementing them
          and see the results.
