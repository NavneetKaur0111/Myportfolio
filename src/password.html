          not possible in todayâ€™s fast lifestyle.

          We depend on the internet for our day-to-day activities and there is
          no end to our dependency on it. It starts by setting an alarm, doing
          online grocery shopping, meeting people online, all the way to saving
          all the important work done for the whole day before leaving for bed.
          To do all the stuff mentioned above, we need some sort of apps and
          websites. Those apps and websites needs some sort of login information
          to run. Keeping those passwords safe is very important.
