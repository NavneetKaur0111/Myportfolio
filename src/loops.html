        <p>
          Do you face difficulties while using loops in JavaScript? If yes, then
          you are at the right place. After reading this article, you will
          understand what each of those loops are doing.
        </p>
        <p>
          Let’s start with understanding the meaning of a loop in JavaScript.
          Loop is a special command that allows us to do something repeatedly.
          Everytime the code in the loop is executed, it is called the iteration
          of a loop. A loop like a GIF image, do the same thing repeatedly.
        </p>
        <p>There are five different types of loops in JavaScript:</p>
        <ul class="loops-list">
          <li><a href="#while">While loop</a></li>
          <li><a href="#do-while">Do while loop</a></li>
          <li><a href="#for">For loop</a></li>
          <li><a href="#for-of">For of loop</a></li>
          <li><a href="#for-in">For in loop</a></li>
        </ul>

        <div id="while">
          <h2>While loop</h2>
          <h3>Syntax-</h3>
          <pre>
            while(condition) {
              Statements
            }         
          </pre>
          <p>
            In the “while” loop, a set of statements executes until a specific
            condition is true. Before executing the code, a condition is
            checked. If the test condition evaluates to true, code is executed.
            A very light example is eating until you are full. Before having a
            bite, check if you are not full. Similarly, before executing the
            code, check if the condition is true.
          </p>
          <h3>Example</h3>
          <pre>
            const i = 0;
            while ( i > 0){
              console.log(‘value of i is’ + i);
            }

            output-
             
          </pre>
        </div>

        <div id="do-while">
          <h2>Do while loop</h2>
          <h3>Syntax-</h3>
          <pre>
          	do{
          	  statements
          	} while (condition);                     
          </pre>
          <p>
            In the “do while” loop, the computer executes the code once at least
            before the condition is checked. If the condition evaluates to true,
            code gets executed again or else the loop will stop.
          </p>
          <h3>Example-</h3>
          <pre>
          	const i = 0;
            	do {
            	  console.log(‘value of i is ‘ + i );
              } while ( i < 5);  
              
            output- 
              value of i is 0
              . 
              . 
              value of i is 5
          </pre>
          <p>
            In the above example, computer will log ‘value of i is 0’. Then it
            will check the condition ‘i > 0’ which will evaluate to false and
            loop will stop. Hence, the set of statements will execute at least
            once.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="for">
          <h2>For loop</h2>
          <h3>Syntax-</h3>
          <pre>
            	for([initialize expression]; [condition]; [increment expression]) {
            	  statements
            	}                     
          </pre>
          <p>
            In the “for” loop, you can initialize an expression ( let i = 0 )
            and in every iteration, you can update that expression . You can
            skip the initialization of an expression and just put a semi-colon
            instead. Like “while” loop, a “for” loop is also executed until the
            condition is true.
          </p>
          <h3>Example-</h3>
          <pre>
          	for(let i = 0; i < 10; i++){
          	  console.log( i + ‘ is less than 10.’);
            }    
            
            output-
              0 is less than 10.
              .
              .
              .
              9 is less than 10.
          </pre>
          <p>
            In the above example, a variable “i” is initialized, and is
            incremented in every iteration. A condition is checked that if “i”
            is less than 10, then execute the code.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="for-of">
          <h2>For of loop</h2>
          <h3>Syntax-</h3>
          <pre>
          	for(let item of array){
          	  statements
          	}                                  
          </pre>
          <p>
            The “for of loop” is a special loop that iterates over an array of
            items and executes the set of statements for every particular item.
          </p>
          <h3>Example-</h3>
          <pre>
          	const basket = [‘apple’, ‘banana’, ‘mango’, ‘kiwi’];
       	    for(let fruit of basket) {
          	  console.log(fruit);
             }  
             
            output-
              apple
              banana
              mango
              kiwi
            </pre
          >
          <p>
            In the above example, there is an array of fruits called basket.
            “For of loop” is iterating over all the items of the array and
            logging them into the console.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div id="for-in">
          <h2>For in loop</h2>
          <h3>Syntax-</h3>
          <pre>
          	for(let item in object){
          	  statements
          	}                                   
          </pre>
          <p>
            The “for in” loop is a special loop, which iterates over an object
            and execute the set of statements for that particular item.
          </p>
          <h3>Example-</h3>
          <pre>
          	const cart = {
          	  Juice: 12,
              Cake: 1,
          	  Apples : 1,
          	};
            for(let items in cart){
          	  console.log(item);
            }   
            
            output-
              12
              1
              1
          </pre>
          <p>
            In the above example, there is an object named cart. The loop is
            going over all the items in cart object one by one, and for every
            item, the loop executes the code.
          </p>
        </div>
