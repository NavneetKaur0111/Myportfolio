        My name is Navneet Kaur. I was born in India. India is a country with
        many diverse cultures and people who believe in their traditions. They
        enjoy celebrating festivals with colors, lights and delicious food. They
        love to get together on special occasions and often do sleepovers at
        friend’s or relative’s houses.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have a joint family in India which includes three nuclear families of
        my dad and his two brothers. Every night, I used to listen to stories
        from our grandparents, and in those stories, they try to give moral
        values to their children. I love having quality time with my family.
      </p>
      <p>
        My hobbies are drawing cartoons and landscapes, coding, cooking,
        listening to music, and dancing. When I was a kid, I used to practice
        and improve my dance moves with my younger sister. My favorite style of
        dance are my culture’s traditional styles, Gidda and Bhangra. It needs
        so much energy and stamina to do those dances.

        I came to Canada with a dream of becoming a skilled software developer.
        I want to master my profession and become one of the finest web
        developers around. Always doing my work with zeal. I want to put great
        effort into my work.
