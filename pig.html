          Pig is a dice game played by two players. The best thing about the
          game is the player can roll the dice as many times as they want. The
          twist is if you get 1 on any of the two dies, you lose all the current
          scores, and the turn is switched to other player. Below is a diagram
          explaining the working of the game:

          I worked with my two friends on this project. To write a working code,
          all we need is logic and syntax. In this game, we started with rolling
          both dies. We accomplished that by generating two random numbers from
          1 to 6. Then, add them up and sort them in the current score. To make
          rolling the dice more realistic, we used pictures to represent numbers
          on the dice. It was a little tricky for us to change the dice picture
          by changing the path of the image source according to the random
          number we got. But finally, after some hard work, we figured that out.
        </p>
        <pre>
     
          function getRandomInt(min, max) {
            return Math.floor(Math.random() * (max + 1 - min)) + min;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          When any of the random numbers generated is 1, then the current score
          becomes 0 and the player's turn get switched. There are some different
          styles to show which player is active. Whenever the user clicks on the
          hold button, the active player is changed. There is a switch function
          which changes the style of both the players. The diagram below
          explains when the switched function is evoked and what does it do.

          Working on reset was very easy for this project. It was just finding
          the score boxes for both the players and changing the text content of
          every score into 0. We can get the score box content by giving
          different id names to the boxes and then searching for those names
          when we want. It was quite easy and interesting.
        </p>
        <pre>
          function reset() {
            let playerTotalScore = document.querySelectorAll(".player-score");
            let currentPlayerScore = document.querySelectorAll(".player-current-score");
            for (let x = 0; x < 2; x++) {
              playerTotalScore[x].textContent = 0;
              currentPlayerScore[x].textContent = 0;
            }
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          Adding the current score into the total score when the user clicks
          hold was a little tricky. All we need to do is take the content from
          the current score and add it into the total score and set the current
          score to 0, but it took some time to do that. The code below
          represents all we did to add the score
        </p>
        <pre>
          function addScore() {
            let playerCurrScore = document.querySelector(".active .player-current-score");
            let playerTotalScore = document.querySelector(".active .player-score");
            let totalscore = parseInt(playerTotalScore.textContent);
            totalscore += parseInt(playerCurrScore.textContent);
            playerTotalScore.textContent = totalscore;
            playerCurrScore.textContent = 0;
          }
        </pre>
        <p>
          In coding projects, you can barely write working code without any
          silly errors. Some little errors will always be there and the same
          happened with us, but we checked all the fine details of the program
          and we got the error that we were not changing the string (alphabetic
          number) into integer (mathematic number). That is why I like peer
          programming. When somebody sees you coding, they can easily find the
          error when you are not seeing i
        </p>
        <p class="conclusion">
          So, this is how we worked on this Pig Game. I think after this, you
          have a little idea about how coding can be done for a game project. If
          you want to know more, you can start learning from ‘HTML and CSS’ page
          in this portfolio.
